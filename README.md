# Node.js

This is a fork from [](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node) but using tests builds instead of releases. Please refer to the original repo for documentation.

## Important note

I removed the gpg part from the dockerfiles because it was geetting in the way.... If someone could help me figure out what is happening I would be gratefull. My guess is that test builds are not signed....
